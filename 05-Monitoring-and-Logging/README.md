   - Select monitoring and logging tools suitable for the project (e.g., Prometheus, ELK Stack).

2. **Step 2: Install and Configure Tools**
   - Install and configure the chosen monitoring and logging tools.
   - Set up data sources and indices for monitoring and logging.

3. **Step 3: Set Up Monitoring Metrics**
   - Define metrics and alerts for monitoring system and application performance.

4. **Step 4: Implement Logging**
   - Integrate logging into the application.
   - Send logs to the logging stack for centralization.
