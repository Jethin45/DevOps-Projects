# Kubernetes Orchestration

## Overview
This project focuses on orchestrating containerized applications using Kubernetes. Kubernetes provides features such as scaling, load balancing, and automated deployments.

## Tools Used
- Container Orchestration Tool (e.g., Kubernetes)
- Docker (for containerization)

## Steps
1. **Step 1: Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster**
   - Install and configure a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using Minikube for local development).

2. **Step 2: Deploy Containerized Application**
   - Deploy the Dockerized application to the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Use Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) to define deployments and services.

   ```yaml
   # Example Kubernetes Deployment YAML
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: sample-app
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: sample-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: sample-app
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: sample-app
             image: your-username/sample-app:latest
